Hi, I'm Paul!
I have a background in finance and economics, and I'm passionate about combining this with my growing interest in programming. 
Over the past few years, I've been diving deep into Python, building projects and exploring data analysis, stock analysis, and financial modeling. 
I'm currently working towards a career transition and aiming to pursue a master's degree in quantitative finance or data science.

Feel free to reach out to me at campos.paul@outlook.com. I’m always excited to connect with fellow enthusiasts and professionals!
